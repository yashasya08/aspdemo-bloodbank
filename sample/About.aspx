       Most blood donors are volunteers. However, sometimes, a patient may want to donate blood a couple of weeks before undergoing surgery, so that his or her blood is available in case of a blood transfusion. Donating blood for yourself is called an autologous donation. Volunteer blood donors must pass certain criteria, including the following:<br />
<ul style=" font-size:20px; ">
<li>Must be at least 16 years of age, or in accordance with state law<br /> </li>  

<li>Must be in good health<br /></li>

<li>Must weigh at least 110 pounds<br /></li>

<li>Must pass the physical and health history exam given before donation<br /></li>

<li>Some states permit people younger than 16 or 17 years to donate blood, with parental consent.</li>
</ul>
